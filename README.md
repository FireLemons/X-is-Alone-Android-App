## Synopsis

We developed an android application "X is Alone" is a learning application, designed to make learning algebra an engaging expierence.  

## Description

The app starts by generating an equation X = to some constant.   
It makes two stacks one of numbers and other of operators. Each number in the number stack is applied with an operation from the operation stack and the result is a complicated polynomial equation.  
At this point the user will be given the numbers stack and the user must undo the operations.  

For example :  
X = 1  
Numbers stack = 2, 3    
Operations stack = * +  

result = (2x + 3 = 5)  

User swipes left to subtract 3 and swipes down to divide by 2 to win
